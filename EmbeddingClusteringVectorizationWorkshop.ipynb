    "**What is Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to transform words into vector representations.\n",
    "It learns these word vectors (embeddings) from a large collection of text so that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who developed it and when?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec was developed by a team of researchers at Google, led by Tomas Mikolov, in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who currently maintains and supports new releases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original research came from Google, the open-source Python library gensim now maintains Word2Vec functionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 🌱 What Is a Dendrogram?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dendrogram** is a **tree-like diagram** that shows how words are grouped into clusters based on their co-occurrence patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each **leaf node** (at the left) is a word from the vocabulary.\n",
    "* Words that **frequently co-occur** are joined into **branches**.\n",
    "* The **horizontal axis** shows the **distance** (or dissimilarity) between merged clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Shorter horizontal lines** → more similar words\n",
    "  * **Longer lines** → more dissimilar\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What This Means\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dendrogram shows how the words are **grouped step-by-step**.\n",
    "* It begins by clustering the **most similar pairs of words** (based on co-occurrence).\n",
    "* Then it merges those groups into larger clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"jury\"` and `\"election\"` might co-occur often → they appear close together.\n",
    "* `\"the\"` and `\"of\"` may appear often but with many different words, making them less specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Fewer Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The message in the code mentions:\n",
    "> \"you need to experiment it with less words...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* That’s because **hierarchical clustering** requires computing pairwise distances.\n",
    "* Large vocabularies make the **linkage matrix** large and slow to process.\n",
    "* A **small subset** (e.g., 20–30 words) gives a faster and more readable result.\n",

    "### 🧠 Introduction to GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is GloVe?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)** is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to learn word embeddings from large amounts of text data. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GloVe** is a word embedding model that learns **vector representations of words** by using **global word co-occurrence statistics** from a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Word2Vec (which learns embeddings through local context windows), GloVe builds a **co-occurrence matrix** and then learns word vectors from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who developed it and when?**\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe was developed by researchers at **Stanford University**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jeffrey Pennington**, **Richard Socher**, and **Christopher Manning**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was first introduced in **2014**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who currently maintains and supports new releases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The official code and pretrained models are available at:\n",
